Effect of various steps in altGDmin-MRI.

To generate Table II:

1. Load the .mat files in the Dataset folder (Copy and paste the .mat files in the same folder contating the files).

2.  Run Main_altGDmin_various_steps.m: This run only Mean, only altGDmin, Mean+altGDmin, altGDmin-MRI and calculate NMSE (Normalized Mean Square Error), Time required for each step and save these results in Comparison.txt [Errpr(Time)].
